"""kauldron API."""

# Do NOT add anything here !!
# Indeed, top-level `__init__.py` makes it hard to import a specific sub-module
# without triggering a full import of the codebase.
# Instead, the public API is exposed in `kd.py`

# A new PyPI release will be pushed everytime `__version__` is increased
# When changing this, also update the CHANGELOG.md
__version__ = '1.3.0'
