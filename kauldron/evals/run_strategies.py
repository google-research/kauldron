"""Run strategies.

The `RunStrategy` are defined in the Kauldron konfig, but also imported in the
KXM launcher (to detect which eval jobs to launch).
"""

class RunStrategy:
  """Base class for info on how to run the evaluation.

  `RunStrategy` are divided into:

  * Strategies which run along train (in the same XM job):
    * `EveryNSteps`: Run evaluation every `X` steps
    * `Once`: Run a single evaluation after `X` steps
  * Strategies which run in a separate XManager job:
    * `StandaloneEveryCheckpoint`: Run evaluation every time a new checkpoint is
      found. Note that if eval is too slow, itermediate checkpoints will be
      skipped.
    * `StandaloneLastCheckpoint`: Only run evaluation once, after train has
      completed.

  Evaluators run in a standalone job can be grouped together through the
  `job_group='group_name'` attribute. This allow to save resources by sharing
  the same job for multiple evaluators.

  Example:

  ```python
  shared_run = kd.evals.StandaloneEveryCheckpoint(
      job_group='separate',
      # Standalone evaluators supports all `kxm.Job` parameters.
      platform='a100=1',
  ))

  cfg.evals = {
      'eval0': kd.evals.Evaluator(run=kd.evals.EveryNSteps(100)),
      'eval1': kd.evals.Evaluator(run=shared_run),
      'eval2': kd.evals.Evaluator(run=shared_run),
  }
  ```

  The XManager experiment will containing 2 tasks: `train` (running `eval0`)
  and `separate` (running `eval1` and `eval2`).

  Those objects are never resolved by the Kauldron Trainer config (to avoid
  XManager dependency).

  Currently, the Kauldron XM launcher hardcode assumptions on the classes here.
  Contact us if you need more flexibility and for custom run behavior.
